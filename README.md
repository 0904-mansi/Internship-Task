# WineQualityPrediction

Given a set of features as inputs, the task here is to predict the quality of wine on a scale of 0 - 10. I have solved it as a regression problem using Linear Regression.
Dataset

## The dataset used here is Wine Quality Data set from Kaggle

# Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

    fixed acidity
    volatile acidity
    citric acid
    residual sugar
    chlorides
    free sulfur dioxide
    total sulfur dioxide
    density
    pH
    sulphates
    alcohol

# Output variable (based on sensory data): quality (score between 0 and 10)

## Dependencies

    Python
    Pandas
    matplotlib
    numpy
    scikit-learn
